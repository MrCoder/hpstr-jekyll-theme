# Articles Read in July 2013

1. [Jitbit's SQL interview questions](http://www.jitbit.com/news/181-jitbits-sql-interview-questions/).
> A basic SQL interview question list and its answer. Basic `select`, `join on`, etc. Also there is a debate in the comments
> about whether a modern developer should learn these basic DB technologies.

2. [Java Basic Input and Output](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J5b_IO.html).
> Java I/O is not as simple as you might think it should be. For example, in what scenarios, should you use BufferedInputStream?
