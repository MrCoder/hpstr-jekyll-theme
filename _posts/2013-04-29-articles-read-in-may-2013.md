# Articles read in May 2013

1. [What is require](http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/getting-started/what-is-require). It talks about `require` in NodeJs,
but my copied version might also be useful: http://xiaopeng.me/2013/05/05/understanding-require-in-nodejs .

1. [Installing node js npm redis on mac osx](http://jason.pureconcepts.net/2011/12/installing-node-js-npm-redis-mac-os-x/).
It talks about how to install `redis` on mac os.

1. [CompoundJs Docs](http://compoundjs.com/docs.html). A guid for creating a simple blog with compoundjs (which is based
on express). It is not so good as it looks like. If you find it confusing, please find my version: xxx(todo).
